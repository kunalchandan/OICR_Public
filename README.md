Welcome
This repository contains any and all public work I will generate during my Co-op at the OICR. Work I put in here is not related to current projects, and is only for the purpose of learning.
What is in here you ask?

I learn best by doing, and my first contribution is the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm. I hope that displays correctly, otherwise you'll have to look it up. I made this in the hopes of learning more about how some of the tools in the lab work. Obviously this algorithm is not limited in its scope and has applications everywhere including NLP.

My second contibution is going ot be a set of examples of pargument parsers in Python. I need to learn this for a set of tools that I will be generating for out internal cBioPortal instance.

Cooliose! I'll get around to finishing the Needleman Algorithm soon!
